### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am MÃ­riam and I am a Full Stack Developer & CUX Designer.
I have a background in Linguistics and Computational Linguistics, and I combine my expertise in both language and tech to elevate user experiences. I am passionate about human-computer interaction and am dedicated to work on building a more affective, human-centered technology.

### ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m looking for job opportunities within Web Development and Conversation Design.
I have experience in developing full-stack single page applications using React. I have also worked with Volvo Truck Technologies in developing an implementation of the driver's handbook in Alexa. It was a success and everyone loved the result ðŸ˜„.

### âš¡ My goal for 2020 is to collaborate on projects that help promote the presence and inclusion of minorities in tech.
Especially women and girls interested in STEM careers.

### ðŸ“« I am always up for discussing any new opportunities or tech-related issues that can help improve our beloved tech community. 
Don't hesitate to reach me via e-mail: msanchezalcon.msa@gmail.com.
