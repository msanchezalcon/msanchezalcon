ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m **MÃ­riam**, a **Full Stack Developer** from sunny **Spain** ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, now exploring the cool vibes of **Norway** ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´. 
My journey into tech was driven by a genuine passion for problem-solving and a desire to create a positive impact.

ðŸŒ‰ I am dedicated to bridging the gap between technology and user experience. For me, embracing tech is not just about mastering the latest tools; itâ€™s about understanding the impact we can have and using our skills to drive meaningful change.

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self, name, location):
        self.name = name
        self.location = location
        self.interests = ["traveling", "collaborating", "remote work", "Spanish croquettes", "cats"]
        self.motto = "Technology must be intuitive and accessible to all."

    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi! I'm {self.name}, a developer based in {self.location}. I enjoy {', '.join(self.interests)}. Motto: '{self.motto}'"

miriam = Developer("MÃ­riam", "Oslo")
print(miriam.introduce())  
```
